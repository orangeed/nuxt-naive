# Naive UI Nuxt Demo

## Prequisite

Make sure you have `naive-ui@>=2.29.0` installed.

Personally I recommend you using pnpm to install deps.

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Setup

You can clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/07akioni/naive-ui-nuxt-demo.git
cd naive-ui-nuxt-demo
```

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/deployment) for more information.
